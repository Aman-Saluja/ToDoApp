# ToDoApp
I have created a To-Do application using Java through which a new user can register and an existing user can log in using their saved credentials. Once they login, they have the option of viewing their existing tasks(unique for the user that has logged in), adding a new task, this task can be of two types : Urgent/Important task or any other task of lower priority. Once they add a task all their tasks are displayed along with the newly added task.

They can also choose to edit or update their tasks using a button that has been provided. Such an app would allow the users to keep track of their day to day tasks and would help them in remembering what tasks they need to get done on priority and what tasks are less important.

The application starts off by asking the user if they have registered on the To Do List application before. If they are a new user, they are directed to the registration page and if they are an already registered user, they are directed to the login page.
